In our camp, we make robotics fun for students ages 7 - 13. Here are some things your child will be able to do:

    <br/>• Build and program innovative Lego robots
    <br/>• Compete in battle bot competitions
    <br/>• Play robot soccer
    <br/>• Meet other STEM interested students

<br/>
<br/>No experience is required!

With branches in Brookline, Newton, Lexington, Acton, as well as New York City, we teach over 1000 students every semester and summer.
Students can choose weekly afterschool & weekend classes in everything from Lego Robotics to coding with Minecraft, Scratch, Python and Java. 
Our advanced students compete in coding competitions & build mobile apps for hackathons.
Through the academic year we mentor and coach First Lego League Robotics Teams (FLL) as well as First Tech Challenge Teams (FTC).
